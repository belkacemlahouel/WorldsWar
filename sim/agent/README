Each agent creates influences which lead to actions.
	Ex: mother creates an influence to add a given number of babies
		-> actions "create baby"
		-> calls instanciator
		-> adds agents to simulation loop

BE CAREFUL: Babies are not supposed to do anything...

MOTHER: 0.1
	Contains the probability law for instanciations
	Instanciations, between X and Y babies each loop

GATHERER: 0.45
	Look for food (biggest qty AND effect analysis)
	if found : dropPheromone - go there - pick...
	else look for pheromone food (strongest) : go there
	else wander

NURSE: 0.2
	Look for hurt guys (life < CST = MAX_LIFE/2?)
	if found : dropDanger - go there - nurse
	else look for pheromone danger (strongest) : go there
	else wander

SOLDIER: 0.3
	Look for ennemies
	if found (and not too much) dropPheromone - go there - attack...
	else if too much dropbPheromone - run
	else look for pheromone danger : go there
	else wander

UNDERTAKER: 0.04
	Look for deads (friends) : bury -> supress the body - drop pheromone danger
	If ennemy -> bury body -> creates meat - drop pheromone food
	else look for pheromone danger
	else wander

THESE ARE SIMPLE BEHAVIORS TO GET US STARTED... IF IMPROVEMENT, WE'LL DISCUSS THEM LATER.
