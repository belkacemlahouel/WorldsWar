This README file is here to help you understand what is done with
RESOURCES/EFFECTS in this project.
It contains some ENVIRONMENT rules.

*** About EFFECTS
EFFECTS are about what happens to the Entity when it eats some
of this resource, even though this resource might be used for construction... (Enhancement)

Even if we code enum to store effects for each kind of resource,
we need to have to have the eat method overidden for each kind of food.
This information only helps us to speed up the decicion process.

To each EFFECT we link a grade [-2, 2]:
	- VERYBAD
	- BAD
	- NEUTRAL
	- GOOD
	- VERYGOOD
