THIS README FILE EXPLAINS BODY CARACTERISTICS, AND THE CORRESPONDING METHODS.
SOME ENVIRONMENT LAWS ARE DETAILLED HERE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

******************************* CHARACTERISTICS ******************************

THESE VARIABLES ARE STORED IN THE BODY. FINAL ATTRIBUTES NEVER CHANGE. WE
SPECIFY THEM WHEN CALLING CONSTRUCTOR. RANDOM VALUES ARE STORED IN
ABSTRACTBODY TO SIMPLIFY THINGS. RANDOM VALUES INTRODUCE OFFSETS. NOT ALL
ATTRIBUTES NEED THIS KIND OF OFFSET. AS AN ENHANCEMENT, WE MAY CHANGE SOME OF
THESE VALUES IN INHERITING CLASSES.

THSE RANDOM VALUES (OFFSETS) ARE CALLED ONLY AT CONSTRUCTION. IT IS NOT FAIR,
AS ONE HIT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY MORE EFFICIENT AS THE NEXT ONE. TO SOLVE THIS,
WE SHOULD ADD RANDOM VALUES IN THE INFLUENCE SOLVER. SO THAT AT EACH STEP,
ANOTHER OFFSET IS APPLIED, MAKING THE SMILUATION MORE REALISTIC.

private final int TRANSPORT_CAPA;			// Max weight that could be carried
private final int EATING_CAPA;				// Max weight that could be eaten at once
private final int MOVING_REACH;				// Max number of cases to be crossed at once
private final int VISION_REACH;				// Max vision distance (nb of cases) linked with Frustrum def
private final int DEFENSE;					// Defense, in a given unit: resistance to applied damage
private final int STRENGTH;					// Strength, in a given unit
private final int MAX_AGE;					// Max age of the given entity, in seconds
private final int MAX_LIFE;					// Max life for a given entity, in vitality points
private final int LIFE_LOSS;				// Regular life loss, at each turn
private final int CREATION_TIME;			// Time of creation, in seconds
private final int ADULT_AGE;				// Time starting from which the body is no longer a baby, in seconds
private final int TRIBE_ID;					// Tribe ID to help our guys to recognize pheromones and friends
private final int MAX_BODY_SIZE;			// Maximum body size, in % (between 0 and 100)
private final FrustrumType FRUSTRUM_TYPE; 	// Type of frustrum for this entity.

private final HashMap<WorldObjectType, EffectType> EFFECTS;
											// Effects for each kind of Food

private Collection<AbstractResource> mycargo;
											// Current transported resources for this body
private AbstractFrustrum myfrustrum;		// Current frustrum
private AbstractEnvironment myenv;			// Current environment
private Direction mydir;					// Current direction of this body
private MyPoint2D mypos;					// Current position of this body
private int mylife;							// Current remaining life of this body
private int mysize;							// Current size of this body (%)

************************************* USE ************************************

NORMALLY, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CALL ALL POSSIBLE GETTERS, BECAUSE THESE
STORED INFORMATION ARE ONLY HERE FOR THE BODY AND ITS CORRESPONDING AGENT
(INNER ACCESS ONLY).

BUT WE PROVIDE ALL INTERESTING GETTERS. SO YOU CAN USE THEM AS IT PLEASES YOU.

WHEN WE CALL THE INFLUENCE SOLVER, IT WILL ASK FOR SOME OF THESE ATTRIBUTES,
SUCH AS DEFENSE, TO COMPUTE THE ACTUAL LIFE VARIATION TO APPLY. THAT'S WHY
THEY ARE FINALLY USEFUL.

THE BODY CAN EAT SOMETHING, IF IT IS ON THE SAME POSITION; MEANING THIS WORKS
IF THE BODY CARRIES IT, OR IF IT IS ON THE FLOOR. WE HAVE TO GIVE THE METHOD
THE CONTAINING DATA-STRUCTURE SO THAT WE REMOVE SOME OF THIS RESOURCE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILD NEW FRUSTRUM
IS FRIEND
APPLY LIFE VARIATION: DOESN'T CARE ABOUT LIFE DEFENSE
EAT: FOR EACH KIND OF RESOURCE
PRODUCE PHEROMONE: FOR EACH KIND OF PHEROMONE
IS BABY
MOVE

GET CURRENT FRUSTRUM
GET ENVIRONMENT
GET POSITION
GET DIRECTION
GET VISION REACH
GET MOVING REACH
GET EATING CAPA
GET TRANSPORT CAPA
GET STRENGTH
GET DEFENSE
GET MAX LIFE
GET MAX AGE
GET SIZE
GET LIFE LOSS
GET CARGO

************************************* TODO ***********************************

ABSTRACT BODY SHOULD IMPLEMENT MORPHABLE.
ENHANCEMENT: CAPACITY = MIN{VOLUME, WEIGHT, NB_ELEM} WHEN CARRYING SOMETHING
