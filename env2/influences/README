Some influences are stored in bodies, other are stored in cells,
and others (motion) in a specific list inside the simulator.

The corresponding influence solver is "near" the storage location. 

IN SIMULATOR:
	Motion
	CreateBaby

IN CELLS: (we only iterate on cells which are modified)
	DropPheromone
	Pick
	Put
	RemoveMe

IN BODIES:
	Attack/Cure
	BuryDead
	Eat
	KillMyself
